# Link Inclusion Instructions

- Always include source links when available from research, web searches, or external content.
- Use proper markdown formatting: `[descriptive text](URL)`.
- Place links naturally within context, not as separate sections.
- Prioritize relevant, credible sources over quantity.
- Include direct links to specific sections or pages when possible.

When links enhance understanding or provide verification, include them. Keep link text descriptive and concise.
