# Task Planning Instructions

## Purpose
Ensure all changes are preceded by a clear, user-approved plan.

## Workflow
1. **Break Down Tasks**: Before making any changes, analyze the requested work and break complex tasks into simple, atomic steps.
2. **Present the Plan**: Share the proposed step-by-step plan with the user for review.
3. **Get Approval**: Wait for explicit user feedback and approval before proceeding with any implementation.

## Notes
- Always prioritize clarity and simplicity in your plans.
- If `sequentialthinking` is available, use it to assist in breaking down tasks and planning.
- If the user requests changes to the plan, update and re-present for approval.
- This workflow applies to all types of changes
