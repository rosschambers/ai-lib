# Enhance Memory Instructions

- When a user brings up a topic, search for existing notes or records related to that topic using available memory tools.
- If relevant notes exist, retrieve and use them to inform responses.
- Add new information or append to existing notes on the topic, ensuring updates are clear and concise.
- Only use memory tools if available; otherwise, respond generically without note management.
- Keep all note handling generic, reusable, and adaptable for future tools or workflows.
