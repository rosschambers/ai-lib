# TODO - AI Tools Library Roadmap

## üéØ Personal AI Preferences

### Default Tool Integration
**Goal:** Install generic user preferences that always include sequential thinking and memory tools

**Implementation Approaches:**
- [ ] **Global User Preferences Template**
  - Create generic `~/.ai-preferences/global-settings.json` template
  - One-way sync from repo to user directory with default tool preferences
  - Template includes sequential thinking and memory as always-enabled tools
  - User can extend but not modify the synced base preferences

- [ ] **Platform Integration Scripts**
  - Install scripts that configure each AI platform to use global preferences
  - VS Code: modify global settings.json to include default tools
  - Browser extensions: configure to inject standard preferences
  - Generic configuration that works across platforms without project dependencies

- [ ] **Universal AI Preference Format**
  - Standard JSON/YAML format for AI tool preferences
  - One-way sync from this repo to user's global AI config directory
  - Platform adapters that read generic format and apply to specific tools
  - Base preferences (sequential thinking + memory) with user extension points

### Memory System Integration
**Goal:** Persistent memory across AI conversations and sessions

**Implementation Approaches:**
- [ ] **Local Knowledge Graph**
  - SQLite-based personal knowledge store
  - Automatic extraction of important context from conversations
  - Semantic search across conversation history
  - Privacy-first approach (all data stored locally)

- [ ] **GitHub-Based Memory**
  - Use GitHub Issues/Discussions as structured memory storage
  - Automated tagging and categorization of memories
  - Cross-reference with code repositories and projects
  - Search and retrieval via GitHub's API

- [ ] **MCP Memory Server**
  - Implement Model Context Protocol server for persistent memory
  - Integration with various AI platforms through MCP
  - Shareable memory contexts between team members
  - Advanced querying and relationship mapping

## üîß Claude Integration

### Instruction Synchronization
**Goal:** Sync VS Code instructions with Claude-based ones using generic formats and build/deploy automation

**Research: Existing Tools & Solutions**
- [ ] **Cursor Rules Sync Tools**
  - Evaluate cursor-rules/vscode-settings sync utilities
  - Test compatibility with Claude Projects API
  - Assess automation capabilities for multi-platform deployment

- [ ] **AI Prompt Management Platforms**
  - Research PromptLayer, Weights & Biases Prompts, LangSmith
  - Evaluate template management and version control features
  - Test export/import capabilities for cross-platform sync

- [ ] **Configuration Management Tools**
  - Investigate Ansible/Terraform for AI config deployment
  - Test dotfiles management approaches for AI instructions
  - Evaluate GitHub Actions for automated instruction sync

**Generic Instruction Format Design**
- [ ] **Universal Instruction Schema**
  - Create YAML/JSON schema for platform-agnostic AI instructions
  - Support conditional logic (applyTo, platform-specific overrides)
  - Include metadata (version, description, dependencies, tags)
  - Template variable system for reusable instruction components

- [ ] **Instruction Categories & Composition**
  - Base instructions (coding style, response format, behavior)
  - Domain-specific instructions (web dev, data science, docs)
  - Project-specific overrides and extensions
  - Composable instruction modules with dependency resolution

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Mapping**
  - VS Code: `.instructions.md` file format with frontmatter
  - Claude Projects: API-compatible instruction format
  - ChatGPT: Custom instructions and conversation starters
  - Generic CLI: instruction injection for any AI tool

**Build/Deploy Pipeline Options**
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Automation**
  - Trigger on instruction file changes in repo
  - Convert generic instructions to platform-specific formats
  - Deploy to VS Code settings, Claude Projects, user directories
  - Support for multiple user accounts and team deployment

- [ ] **Local CLI Tool**
  - `ai-sync` command for manual instruction deployment
  - Watch mode for automatic sync during development
  - Validation and testing of instruction conversions
  - Rollback and version management capabilities

- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks & Git Integration**
  - Validate instruction syntax before commit
  - Auto-generate platform-specific files from generic sources
  - Prevent drift between generic and platform-specific instructions
  - Integration with conventional commit standards

**Implementation Priority**
1. **Phase 1**: Generic instruction format + VS Code/Claude converters
2. **Phase 2**: GitHub Actions pipeline for automated sync
3. **Phase 3**: Extended platform support (ChatGPT, local AI tools)
4. **Phase 4**: Team collaboration features and shared instruction libraries
